# advent_of_code_2024

## Intro/context
Decided to have a crack at the 2024 edition of Advent of Code, albeit a little late. \
Also a good opportunity for me to add some stuff to my GitHub profile, as I haven't used it much since its creation.

## Journal/Misc
- 2025/08/09 : Was going to do it in C++, but I figured it'd be quicker to code in Python.
Might switch back to C++ later, if I feel like it. 
- 2025/08/11 : Currently stuck on part 2 of day 5. This one feels like it might be quite complex.
